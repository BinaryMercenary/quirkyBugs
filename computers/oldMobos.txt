Revived a Gigabyte GA-Z68MA-D2H-B3 LGA 1155 and was able to memtest it with vga monitor.  Oddly any hdmi output via onboard or standalone gpu was 100% dead to my existing (Crappy hp) LCD after noticing my memtest usb was indeed booting with the gpu present (usb light was blinking just so) I switched to a better Acer lcd compatibly.  Not a bios issue, and windows would probably sort this on boot BUT man the crappy HP LCD monitor needs to go.
