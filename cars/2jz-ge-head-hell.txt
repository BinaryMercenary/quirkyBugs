I did a compression test before a belt job; replaced a scratche cam, installed the belts; ran another compression test with cylinders one and six failing TERRIBLY.  Leakdown test was just as bad.  Feared/assummed I bent valves on those cyls and pulled the head off only to find an insance amount of carbon was the cause.  Did a valve job and this 230k mile car runs like a monster now.  If you get in the same jam, it's time for some valve maintanance -- hopefully you don't need piston rings, tho (blow-by's prime cause).  If you can't afford the work or down time, tap any suspect valves on the bucket/shim with a light hammer and wooden dowell until your compression test/leakdown comes back or just slap it together and run it.
